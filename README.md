Cortado
==========

#### The simple job application task manager

Having applied to and interviewed with several companies in the past few months, we found it frustrating to keep track of every phone screen, onsite, and cover letter we ever encountered. Email becomes a mess on top of all the spam we receive. Calendars is packed from our busy schedules. Other productivity applications were too generic. There just wasn't a clean way to have everything in one place.

Cortado allows you to seamlessly track your job application process all in one place. No more oversleeping on phone screens. No more missed opportunities from applying too late. No more forgetting to study for that coding challenge.

Features:
- Links to job pages all in one place (no more outdated bookmark folders!)
- Organize offers by priority
- Notifications for upcoming interviews
- Saved user data for simple login from anywhere
